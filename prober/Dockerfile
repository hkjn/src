#
# Build image for prober.
#
# As this is a package, there's nothing to release, but this Dockerfile allows
# us to verify that the package continues building. We don't lock in a specific
# version for vendoring here of our own third party deps like github.com/golang/glog,
# as that can be done in the downstream tools importing our package if appropriate.
