- after mounting UNIX filesystem into Arvo, need to place generators in <ship>/home/gen/
- following https://urbit.org/docs/learn/hoon/hoon-tutorial/generators/, we find
  'naked generators' defined
- naked generator: simply a gate, i.e an anonymous function taking a "sample" or argument
    and producing a noun
  - to create a naked generator, write it into a file in <ship>/home/gen/
  - naked generators can take only one argument
  - can pass a cell to effectively give a pair of arguments
