- reading https://urbit.org/docs/learn/hoon/hoon-tutorial/nouns/
- atom auras: metadata that tells Hoon how to interpret an atom
  - does not change underlying atom data
  - just adds metadata saying "this should be represented as a positive integer,
    string, .."
  - binary atoms: `0b1001`, `0b1001.1101`
  - hexadecimal atoms: `0xdf`, `0xdead.beef`
  - signed decimal atom: `-79`
  - signed binary: `--0b1001`
  - signed hexadecimal: `-0x9d`
  - all of the above are unsigned integer nouns, represented as different atoms
  - prefixing with \`@\` discards aura metadata and shows default
    integer representation
  - the \`@\` syntax casts the expression to raw atom
  - `~zod` is also an atom, in `@p` or planet aura
  - `'foo'` is an atom, in the `@t` or cord aura
- dojo parses expression as we type, so it is impossible to type a
  syntactically invalid expression!
- term: an expression like `%bar-baz` with aura `@tas`
- non-exhaustive list of auras at https://urbit.org/docs/learn/hoon/hoon-tutorial/nouns/#list-of-auras
