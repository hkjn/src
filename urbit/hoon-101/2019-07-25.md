- rune: digraph of two ascii characters together that form a symbol
  - each half of the symbol has a pronounciation
  - like ':-' is col-hep
  - runes makes hoon more concise and clear, with some experience
- col-runes produce cells
  - col-hep takes two expressions and produces cell of those expressions
  - e.g `:-  4  5` produces `[4 5]` cell
  - https://urbit.org/docs/reference/hoon-expressions/rune/col/
  - col-cab or `:_` takes two expressions and produces cell in reverse order
  - good practice to produce most complex expressions at bottom of code
  - col-lus or `:+`
  - col-ket or `:^`
  - col-tar or `:*`
  - hep, les, ket takes two, three or four expressions respectively, forms cells
  - coltar takes arbitrary number of expressions, closed with tistis or `==`
  - expressions can be formatted any way, like
```
> :*  4
      6
      10
      3
      99
==
```
  - colsig or `:~` takes variable number of expressions, constructs list with
    sig or `~` at end
- tis-runes, beginning with tis or `=`
  - tislus or `=+` combines a new noun with the subject
  - all hoon expressions are evaluated relative to a subject
  - the rune pins a variable value to that expression
  - e.g `=+  a=42  (add a 10)`
- dot-runes, beginning with `.`, carry out Nock operations in Hoon
  - dottis or `.=` tests equality with Nock `5`
  - e.g `.=  4  5` evaluates to `%.n`, since `4` and `5` are not equal
  - dotlus or `.+` increments an atom with Nock `4`
  - e.g `.+  5` evaluates to `6`
- three forms of runes, tall and wide-form, and irregular form
  - irregular form is easier to work with, but not all runes have an irregular form
  - the irregular form of `.+  1` is `+(1)`
  - irregular form of `.=  4  5` is `=(4 5)`
- comments: prefixed with col-col, '::'
- cen-runes, beginning with `%`, makes "function calls"
  - cenhep or `%=` calls a gate
  - the `(add 2 3)` expression is the irregular form of `%-  add  [2 3]`
- ket-runes, beginning with '^', are used for casting
  - kethep, or '^-`, explicitly type casts atom to another type
