: thanks to Lucas for inviting me and all of you for coming
: Henrik used to work for Google, also fintech and Bitcoin startups

* Intro / disclaimer

: not particularly qualified, but neither is anyone
:   one person's view, not my company's or anything official (there is no one official)
:   we are all still learning what Bitcoin is, if I am wrong on major points look forward to learning together
:   been aware of Bitcoin since 2010 v0.3 release hit Slashdot
:   was on cryptography list where Satoshi announced whitepaper and v0.1 but it ended up in spam filter
:   left Google 2014 partly to focus more on learning about and contributing to Bitcoin project
:   my main project most of the time since 2015
: shift crypto
:   joined Shift ~2 months ago
:   jonas schnelli co-founder
:   hardware wallet called bitbox, new hw wallet coming Soon (tm)
:   working on node-in-a-box
:   privacy / security: rights, should be accessible to everyone, not sacrificed for convenience
:   equip people to keep their valuable information secure
:   simple + safe
: looking at the history of the system from a few different angles like
:   mythos
:   mining
:   protocol
:   bugs
:   adoption

* Outline

* Pre-history

: pre-history of digital decentralized currencies
: work by Dai, Finney, Szabo, Back
: Bitcoin was first workable system for decentralized digital scarcity

* Problem solved by bitcoin

: decentralized digital scarcity
: physical objects are in one place
: digital data by default is copied
: hard money where supply can't be manipulated without central issuer

* Eras of mining

: CPU
: GPU
: ASIC
:   Pros and cons?
:   should we be ASIC resistant?

* Major protocol upgrades

: P2SH
: CSV/CLTV
:   https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki
: SegWit

* Major bugs/special behavior

: Multisig off by one, need to have extra stack item
: No finite supply until 2014
: recent potential inflation bug
: no evaluate, hardcoding of P2SH

* Mythos

: we are story-telling apes, c.f Sapiens
: Satoshi is the perfect creation myth: anonymous entity that disappeared as mysteriously as they appeared
:   not known that Satoshi has ~1m BTC!
: why is censorship-resistant money needed?
:   because we need separation of money and state: it's too tempting and too much power to control the monetary supply, and say who gets to send money or store it
:   won't bad people use it for bad things?
:   yes, and bricks can also be used to hit people over the head as well as to build a bridge
: sound and hard money
:   backed by physics:
:     hashes are as far as we know one-way functions, easy to go one way but unfeasible to reverse
:     as mining efficiency improves, moves towards thermodynamic limit of energy -> hash rate
:     unwinding history means >50% hash rate of network, and still can't take money from others
:     hash rate to secure network acts as storage tech, hydro / solar  plants otherwise have wasted energy
:     price floor / energy buyer of last resort
:   longest chain standing
:     Lindy effect
:     10 years since genesis block Jan 3rd 2019

* Major adoption / use cases

: cypherpunk tinkertoy
:   hal finney's CPU fan was too loud
:   greg maxwell ran v0.1 under wine, then deleted VM with private keys
: collectibles, szabo
:   lunatic fringe / collectible phase
:   lazslo's pizza
:   $1 USD price
: wave of altcoins
:   2013/2014
: early adopters / store of value phase
:   you are here
:   aspiring digital gold
:   scarce just like tulips, but also divisible, fungibleish, transmittable, ..
: future
:   medium of exchange, maybe, eventually
:   but merchants need to want BTC first
:   20% likely to succeed, via bluematt?
:   ~1.5% market cap of gold currently, does that reflect market belief in success?
:   unit of account
