* Full nodes

- p2p network
- computer programs talking over network
- "full" since many don't fully validate
- .. or store their private keys, being your own bank is hard
- some projects make it easier, like [[https://www.nodl.it/][nodl.it]], [[https://base.shiftcrypto.ch/][BitBox Base]]
: was mostly working on Base for last several weeks personally
: Roland / Stadicus is former 21lectures advanced class student

* Bitcoin Core

- [[https://bitcoincore.org]]
- formerly "Satoshi client", or just "Bitcoin"
- Satoshi called everything "Bitcoin": network, currency, protocol, software
- reference client, shows how to follow rules

* Installing Bitcoin Core

- connect to `22.hkjn.me`, in clean state
  $ ssh 22
  $ tmux
- TOFU fingerprint
  SHA256:GtLyRuFySzrF1yhQwQNTVhRavr30jbNKqBpryxnREDw

- Installation documented in [[https://github.com/hkjn/src/blob/master/talks/21lectures2019/scripts/install_bitcoin_core.sh][`install_bitcoin_core.sh`]]
  git clone https://github.com/hkjn/src
  cd src/talks/21lectures2019/scripts
  less install_bitcoin_core.sh

* Install time!

- run individual commands, or [[https://github.com/hkjn/src/blob/master/talks/21lectures2019/scripts/install_bitcoin_core.sh][the script]]
  bash install_bitcoin_core.sh
- working with `tmux`
  CTRL+B "
  CTRL+B O
- check status
  bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
  bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo | grep -A1 blocks
  bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
  bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | less
  bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b
  bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction ef8e3d21628bea9293145e81f7a00ca34b94507da8546d60874dd32a621618ff 1

* Transaction crash course

- genesis transaction is special
- txns have at least one input, at least one output
- txns prove that they can unlock inputs, and set new locks for outputs
- chain of txns back to coinbase, minting new coins
- "having BTC" means having a coin / utxo
- "addresses" not really a thing

* Why full nodes?

- not your keys, not your coins
- not your node, not your rules
- using block explorers outsources validation and reduces privacy
- "light clients" considered harmful
- "remote controls" often better

: if you look up the balance of an address, and then just afterwars
:  a tx lands there, it's almost guaranteed to be you sending it

* Over to 21

- syncing takes time
  ssh 21
  bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction ef8e3d21628bea9293145e81f7a00ca34b94507da8546d60874dd32a621618ff 1
- confirmations means a tx was included in a block
- blocks are found through process of mining
- address starting with `bc1` are modern Bitcoin addresses
- each node can validate blocks and txns within
- all input are unspent, signatures are valid, sum of outputs < sum of inputs
- mining fee is implicit

* Tor improves privacy

- Tor uses onion routing to obfuscate network requests
- enabling it once Tor is installed means adding to `bitcoin.conf`
  proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
- verify with
  $ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo

* Full node use cases

- verifying incoming payments
- generating outgoing payments
- no need to "help the network"
- your own gold smith
- storing private keys?
- access control? mobile? web UI?
- better tools / integration needed..
: we need more than just the full nodes to get anything useful done,
: such as storing private keys offline on paper wallet, on hardware wallet
: or similar
