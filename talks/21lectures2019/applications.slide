* Applications

- goals: usability, security, privacy
- have to be "easy" to use Bitcoin + LN
- should be more secure rather than less
- should give back more privacy rather than less
- remote controlled full node is ideal

* Disclaimers

- all experimental software
- hard to set up
- some shortcuts to simplify demo
- uncertain what will happen
- DYOR

* Tor

- privacy for networking

* Electrum

- software wallet with integrations to everything
- relatively easy to use
- lot of control over details if you want it

* Electrum demo

- software seeds, with extra entropy
- ledger, coldcard
- importing master public keys

* Electrs

- Electrum by default connects to random servers
- weak privacy towards server, like default Ledger usage with app
- [[https://github.com/romanz/electrs][Electrs]] implements Electrum API
- can run `electrs` in front of `bitcoind` for a personal Electrum server

* Lightning

- offchain protocol that anchors channels onchain
- funding tx puts BTC in 2/2 multisig output
- new offchain txns spend from funding, but are not normally published
- offchain txns swapped back and forth any number of times
- base layer as judge in case of defection
- several implementations like c-lightning, LND, Eclair

* Spark

- desktop and mobile wallet in front of c-lightning
- Tor onion service allows for mobile remote control
- [[https://www.lightningduel.com/]]
- [[https://github.com/fiatjaf/kwh/][kWh]] webln plugin

* Wasabi

- [[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/][Wasabi]] wallet
- software wallet, limited hardware support
- uses CoinJoin, [[https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink][ZeroLink]] protocol
- can improve privacy drastically
- blinded coordinator server
- charges percentage fee

* Sentinel

- [[https://samouraiwallet.com/sentinel][Sentinel]] mobile watch-only wallet
- works online
- don't assume any privacy until you can use your own node

* Samourai

- [[https://samouraiwallet.com/][Samourai]] mobile wallet
- [[https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool][Whirlpool]] GUI pairs with mobile app
- charges flat fee

* Bisq
