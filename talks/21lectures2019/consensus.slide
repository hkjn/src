* Network effects

- by default, better to talk same language
- diverging from protocol has risks
- could be unable to send funds
- could receive something that isn't real Bitcoin
- could produce blocks that are not real Bitcoin

* Forks

- many early changes were hard forks
- soft forks later discovery
- most upgrades can be backwards compatible
- in softfork, if majority hashrate follows new rules, nodes running old rules come along
- consensus rules around what counts as valid txns/blocks
- restricting rules is soft forks
- expanding rules is hard fork
- many rules are very subtle or implicit

* Lower layers solidifying

- "move fast and break things" not a good idea with money
- careful changes, less radical over time
- even straight-forward improvements can become contentious
- miner signalling used to be misunderstood
- mean to signal readiness, not as a vote
- economic full nodes that demand blocks determine rules
- very small but intolerant minority can block hard forks
- cool improvements like [[https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki][bip-schnorr]] coming
- better privacy _and_ scalability means every user wins
