* Why privacy?

- not a new concept in money, or in general
- people seem okay with walls
- total loss of privacy in traditional finance is the radical part
- cash-like levels of privacy for digital money is desirable
- bad guys do use money
- also cars, sandwiches

* Do we have any in Bitcoin?

- on base layer, no, by default not a lot
- onramps like centralized exchanges heavily surveilled
- possible to improve privacy and have convenience
- but rough edges and experimental software
- hard to monetize developing solid tools that integrate well
- need to coordinate and specialize

* Second layer / offchain

- Lightning Network most well known
- but does not need to be fancy, Opendime also is offchain
- only channel open / close tx seen onchain
- LN has source routing
- channels can be private

* What to do?
