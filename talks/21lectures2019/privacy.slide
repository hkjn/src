* Why privacy?

- not a new concept in money
- total loss of privacy in traditional finance is the radical part
- cash-like levels of privacy for digital money is desirable
- bad guys do use money
- also cars, sandwiches

* Do we have any?

- on base layer, by default not a lot
- possible to improve privacy and have convenience
- but rough edges and experimental software
- hard to monetize developing solid tools that integrate well

* Second layer / offchain

- Lightning Network most well known
- does not need to be fancy, Opendime works


* What to do?

- learn: [[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy]]
- experiment with 2nd layer
