* Why do we need mining?

- Bitcoin allows digital scarcity
- must support anonymous participants
- needs something scarce to avoid [[Sybils][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack]]

* What it mining?

- miners produce blocks that full nodes demand
- PoW mining links system to thermodynamics
- heaviest valid chain wins
- "it takes at least this many joules to unwind history"

* Majority attacks

- outproducing rest of network, causing reorgs
- allows censoring txns
- does not allow taking coins
- economically unlikely

* Why PoW mining?

- easy to link digital <-> physical with trust
- very hard without trust
- energy is scarce
- hash functions seem to be one-way functions
- difficulty target and hashing repeatedly takes many tries
- varying a nonce and hashing block contents
- leads to each block being secured by physics

* Ecological disaster?

- in free market, hard to judge what others choose to spend energy on
- you can always sell your kWh for BTC
- Bitcoin produces global price floor for electricity
- location independent, incentivizes cheap energy production
- sun shines during the day, more so in Sahara
