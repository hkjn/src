use curl instead of wget (available on macos)
go slower with initial setup, especially PGP
have more interactive checkpoints / tests to verify that everybody caught up
need more instructors if >12 people
no need for tmux if intent is to interact with server
introduce tmux only if needed, projector works fine
if remote and using tmux, explain commands / purpose more clearly
especially tmux Ctrl+B D to detach (hard to press)
fix typo missing 'attach' for tmux attach
